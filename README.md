# 🤖 Automation
This Repo demonstrate all the scripts I have created for Automation.

## 🎬 ABOUT THE PROJECT
This project is built with keeping automation as a priority. I take different real-life scenarios and try to automate them using Python scripts or Shell scripts. These scenarios may or may not be related to Cybersecurity, which is another field I am passionate about. If we automate tedious and menial jobs, then we can save time (most valuable thing in the world) and money.

## ⚙️ BUILT WITH
👉🏼 Python v3.10.5 scripts
